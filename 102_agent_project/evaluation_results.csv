What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?,"['# Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n\n## Overview\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to interact with external tools and data sources in a standardized way.

What are the main metrics in Ragas?,"['# Ragas: Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment\n\n## Overview\nRagas is a framework for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. It provides metrics to grade the quality of your RAG application without needing human labels for every query.\n\n## Core Metrics', '## Integration with LangSmith\nRagas integrates natively with LangSmith. When you run an evaluation:\n1. Ragas computes the scores locally.\n2. It pushes the detailed trace and scores to LangSmith.\n3. You can view a dashboard showing ""Average Faithfulness"" over time.\n\n## How to use\n```python\nfrom ragas import evaluate\nfrom ragas.metrics import faithfulness, answer_relevancy\n\nresults = evaluate(\n    dataset=my_dataset,\n    metrics=[faithfulness, answer_relevancy]\n)\nprint(results)\n```']",I was able to find that Ragas is a framework for evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
